				<p id="content">It is very strategic based, two teams of five and the objective of the game is to plant the spike. It is one of those Counter Strike type of games but playing a group of preset characters with their unique abilities, feels like a real tactical shooter, There are competitive modes as well which are really fun climbing the ranks.</p>

				<p id="content">Boosting or using another person's account to help you rank up is against the Terms of Service and is a bannable offense. Other behavior like trolling, harassment, or flaming other players is also against the Terms of Service and toxic players can be banned. I played with a jett that was boosted so please enforce this rule as its annoying to play with somebody that sucks.</p>
